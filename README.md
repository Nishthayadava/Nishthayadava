I'm Nishtha Yadav, a passionate self-taught full-stack web developer and a freelance software engineer from India.
My passion for software lies in dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, 
architecture, and code quality of the things I build. I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community
and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
